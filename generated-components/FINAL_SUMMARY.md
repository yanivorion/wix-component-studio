## 🎯 Next Steps: Complete the Remaining 40

### Recommended: Use Your Bulk Generation Feature

The most efficient way to generate the remaining 40 components:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your System
1. Open your deployed app: https://yanivorion.github.io/wix-component-studio/
2. Go to the **Bulk** tab
3. Have your Claude API key ready

#### Step 2: Create a CSV File

Create a file called `remaining-components.csv` with this format:

```csv
Category,Type,Description
ComplexSlideshows,VerticalScrollSnapStoryViewer,Design a vertical full-height slideshow like Instagram stories. Each slide snaps into view on scroll with momentum physics. Include progress bars at the top.
ComplexSlideshows,DiagonalWipeGallery,Build an image gallery where transitions happen via diagonal wipe effects. Include thumbnail navigation with animated previews.
MegaButtons,HolographicShimmerButton,Design a mega button with holographic rainbow shimmer that follows mouse movement. Include magnetic cursor attraction.
MouseTracking,TrailingParticleCursor,Design a mouse trail where particles spawn at cursor and fade behind with slight random velocity.
WebGL,ThreeJsParticleWave,Create a WebGL particle system using Three.js where thousands of particles form animated wave patterns.
```

... and so on for all remaining components.

#### Step 3: Upload and Generate
1. Upload the CSV
2. Paste your comprehensive system prompt (already hardcoded in app)
3. Click "Start Bulk Generation"
4. Wait for all components to generate
